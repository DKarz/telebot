The following telegram-bot is created to make students' lives a bit easier. The main aim of it is collecting some data at one place, data which is spread among the internet and emails. At the current moment the lack of the bot's commands does not give an opportunity to use it frequently. However, the mastering of the programm is still in process, so some improvements are about to be acheived. Moreover, any suggestions are welcome, thus do not hesitate to imform the "author" about it.
